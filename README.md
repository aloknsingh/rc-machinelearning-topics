#Random Collections of Machine Learning Topics


###Why a new book?

There are many information available in so many great books and in Wikipedia and all various resources at universities and various blogs.

However, sometimes, things are not connected i.e if we learn linear algebra or convex optimization or topic modeling. We can get lost in the plethora of options, maths, explanation. 

Many times, I collect books, various information about various algorithms in machine learning, statistics and maths and I like to think of the problem as the following sequence

    Repeat 
        1. Intuition
        2. Motivating Example
        3. Some formal math explanation
        4. Some practical examples and code 
        5. Goto 1. above
    Until (understand the topics)

I, being a engineer, I think the above approach will appeal to more engineer oriented people and they will enjoy it.

Also from my personal stand point, This book acts as the collection of the information and intuition and some basis understanding with the link to the references, which I can consult anytimes and just maintain the connected component of the knowledge and information one has acquired.

This could as well would have been ablog, wiki or the e-book.

The primary goal is to 

1. Some thoughts on random topics on machine learning, data science, statistics and code and programs example.
2. It acts as the quick reference and also the knowledge base for many of the common theme and items and references
